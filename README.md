# Mock Landing Page

This is a simple mock landing page I built to practice and improve my CSS skills. The project focuses on:

- Responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid
- Custom styling with CSS variables
- Clean and organized HTML structure
- Accessibility-friendly CSS resets and best practices for a11y
